# Welcome to the 3D Solar System Simulation! 

##  What's So Cool About This?

Think of this as your very own planetarium, but interactive! Here's what you can do:
- Watch all 8 planets dance around the sun 
- Control how fast each planet moves
- Zoom in and out to see the planets up close 
- Spin around to view the solar system from any angle 
- See Saturn's beautiful rings up close 
- Enjoy a beautiful starry background 

##  Getting Started 

### What You Need
- A computer (any modern one will do!)
- A web browser (Chrome works best, but any modern browser is fine)
- That's it! No fancy software needed 

### Let's Get It Running!

1. **Download the Project**
   - Click the green "Code" button above
   - Choose "Download ZIP"
   - Unzip the folder anywhere you like

2. **Open It Up**
   - Find the `index.html` file
   - Double-click it to open in your browser
   - That's it!  

## How to Play

### Moving Around
- **Left-click and drag**: Spin around to see different views
- **Right-click and drag**: Move the view up, down, left, or right
- **Scroll wheel**: Zoom in and out
- **Sliders on the right**: Make planets move faster or slower

## Want to Make Changes?

### Easy Customizations
In the `script.js` file, you can change:
- Planet colors
- How fast they spin
- How big they are
